Methodology for sizing solar powered irrigation systems

This code outputs the following parameters for solar powered irrigation systems:
- Peak water requirements (in l/ha/day)
- Peak power demand (in kW/ha)
- PV Size (in kW/ha)
- Annual Energy Demand for Agriculture (kWh/ha)
- Electrification Potential (kWh/ha)
- Utilisation factors before and after electrification
- Cost of the system
